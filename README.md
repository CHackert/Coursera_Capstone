## INTRODUCTION / BUSINESS PROBLEM

The US National Safety Council (NSC) has estimated that in the first six months of 2020 the total number of US motor-vehicle fatalities reached 18,300, motor-vehicle related injuries reached 2,086,000 and property damage was over $206 billion USD (ref1).  Helping drivers and pedestrians make good decisions before travelling should substantially reduce the number of accidents and provide for safer and less stressful motor-vehicle travel experience.  Using data collected by the Seattle Police Department (ref2), this project aims to provide useful information regarding varying conditions and their effects on accident severity in the City of Seattle.
